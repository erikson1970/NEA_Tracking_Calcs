    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "   Known potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) are tracked by a world-wide volunteer network of optical telescopes organized by ESA and JPL.  This PHAs observing service works for objects that are known and that due to combination of size, proximity and surface characteristics have a sufficiently high optical albedo to be optically detectable.  The analysis here presents an initial feasibility assessment of a radio frequency (RF) sensor network to detect unknown NEOs and PHAs as well as track known PHAs from the night side of earth (NSoE) using a reference signal from the day side of earth(DSoE).  One of the LibreSpace projects, SATNOGS, interconnects a world-wide network of satellite signal tracking enthusiasts with antennas of modest capabilities.  The analysis will pose and answer the question of what is the sized of a network of \"enthusiast-grade\" [1](#Footnotes) networked radio telescopes that could detect PHAs in the range not visible by ESA and JPL observing volunteers.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Background \n",
    "\n",
    "   The network would use DSoE and NSoE signals to develop passive radar track on NSoE near-earth objects (NEOs) that cross or reside outside of Earth Orbit. NEOs are classified in one of four classes according to their perihelion distance (q), aphelion distance (Q) and their semi-major axes (a): Atens, Apollos, Amors and Atiras[4]. The analysis here examines addresses the former three classes(note 1) because of their orbits location with respect to the earth.  The reference signal would be developed based on specific discrete solar RF radiation sources as isotropic radiators.\n",
    "\n",
    "   notes:\n",
    "   1. Atiras (a < 1 AU, Q < 0.983 AU) don't ever cross outside earth orbit and wouldn't be detectable through backscatter. Forward scatter investigation could complement this work at a later time.\n",
